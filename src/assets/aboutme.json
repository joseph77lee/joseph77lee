  "about": "Hi, I'm Joseph Lee, a Full Stack Developer based in Calgary with over 10 years of experience building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I speak JavaScript and Angular fluently, enjoy working with Spring Boot and Node.js on the backend, and thrive in environments where clean code and good teamwork matter. I've contributed to projects across finance and public sector environments — including supporting federal accreditation systems for the G7 Summit.\n\nThese days, I’ve been diving into vibe coding — rapidly building MVPs to explore new ideas and technologies across different stacks. For me, it's the fastest way to learn, improve, and stay hands-on in real-world scenarios.\n\nBut here’s what people really say about me: I’m the kind of developer you want on your team when something breaks — I stay calm, find the issue fast, and fix it with a smile. I move quickly, adapt even faster, and always bring a positive, collaborative energy to the room. I care about people as much as I care about code.\n\nWhether it’s working with designers, PMs, or fellow devs, I make things better — and not just the product. The process, the communication, the vibe — all of it.\n\nIf you're curious about how I can help your project or team, feel free to reach out. Let's build something great together."
