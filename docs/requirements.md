# Requirements - joseph77lee.com Interactive Portfolio

## üåü Overview

This project is a personal interactive portfolio website built with Angular 20 and Tailwind CSS. It is intended to showcase Joseph Lee's professional background in a memorable, developer-centric format. The UI simulates a terminal interface where users can type commands to reveal specific information.

The target audience includes recruiters, hiring managers, and collaborators who may arrive via LinkedIn, resume links, or personal referrals.

## üìä Objectives

- Present Joseph Lee's career history and technical background in an engaging, interactive way.
- Emphasize front-end development skills, especially Angular, TypeScript, and UI/UX thinking.
- Allow users to explore information at their own pace using command-line style inputs.

## üìÜ Features

### Terminal-Style Interface
- Central terminal window in the layout (desktop & mobile responsive)
- Simulated prompt (e.g., `>` symbol) where users can type commands

- `highlights` ‚Äì Shows strengths related to hiring position or industry
- `download` ‚Äì Provides a downloadable PDF version of the resume

### Interactive Output
